</a>

Enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OmniFocus featuring **native custom perspective access**, hierarchical task display, AI-optimized tool selection, and comprehensive task management.

In plain English: this lets your AI assistant read your OmniFocus data, create tasks/projects, organize subtasks, review perspectives, and help you plan work without you manually jumping between apps.

## 🌠 Why This Project Exists

OmniFocus is already powerful, but it is still mostly a tool you drive by hand.

The bigger idea behind this project is simple:

- less clicking, more conversation
- less manual cleanup, more AI-assisted planning
- less tool memorization, more natural task management

The goal is not just to expose more OmniFocus commands.
The goal is to let you work with OmniFocus like this:

```text
Plan my day.
Clean up my Inbox.
Turn these notes into a project.
Show me what is blocked.
Reorganize these tasks safely.
```

If that feels natural, this MCP server is doing its job.

## 🆕 Latest Release

- **v1.6.11** - Security/dependency refresh: upgraded MCP SDK to 1.29 (resolves all npm audit advisories), fixed a TypeScript build OOM via NodeNext module resolution, translated all tool output and descriptions to English, fixed `get_today_completed_tasks` emitting literal `\n` text, migrated to `registerTool`, removed dead debug scripts, and cut the npm package from 2.1 MB to ~300 kB. Added `npm run smoke` for live verification.
- **v1.6.10** - Fixed Inbox task completion via `edit_item`, fixed AppleScript special-character handling for apostrophes/backslashes, fixed JSON result escaping for special characters, and clarified `batch_add_items` / `mcporter` usage with working examples.
- **v1.6.9** - Added task attachment support: `get_task_by_id` now lists attachment metadata, `dump_database` exports attachment/link metadata, and new `read_task_attachment` returns image attachments as MCP image content when possible.
- **v1.6.8** - Added stable task move support via `move_task` and `edit_item` (`newProjectId/newProjectName/newParentTaskId/newParentTaskName/moveToInbox`) with duplicate-name protection and cycle-prevention checks.
- **v1.6.6** - Added full Planned Date support (create/edit/read/filter/sort/export), including `plannedDate`/`newPlannedDate` and updated task displays.

## 📦 Installation

### Claude Code

#### Quick Install (recommended)
```bash
# One-line installation
claude mcp add omnifocus-enhanced -- npx -y omnifocus-mcp-enhanced
```

#### Alternative methods for Claude Code:

```bash
# Upgrade to latest
npm install -g omnifocus-mcp-enhanced@latest

# Global installation
npm install -g omnifocus-mcp-enhanced
claude mcp add omnifocus-enhanced -- omnifocus-mcp-enhanced

# Local project installation
git clone https://github.com/jqlts1/omnifocus-mcp-enhanced.git
cd omnifocus-mcp-enhanced
npm install && npm run build
claude mcp add omnifocus-enhanced -- node "/path/to/omnifocus-mcp-enhanced/dist/server.js"
```

### Claude Desktop / Cowork

Add the server to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnifocus-enhanced": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "omnifocus-mcp-enhanced"]
    }
  }
}
```

For a local clone, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnifocus-enhanced": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/omnifocus-mcp-enhanced/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config file.

### Using Both Claude Code and Claude Desktop / Cowork

Claude Code and Claude Desktop read separate configurations. If you want to use this MCP server from both, you need to install it in both places — run `claude mcp add` for Claude Code **and** add the entry to `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop / Cowork.

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS 10.15+** - OmniFocus is macOS-only
- **OmniFocus 3+** - The application must be installed and running
- **OmniFocus Pro** - Required for custom perspectives (new features in v1.6.0)
- **Node.js 18+** - For running the MCP server
- **Any MCP-capable client** - Claude Code, `mcporter`, or another MCP host

## 🚦 Start Here

If you only want the fastest way to understand this project, remember this:

1. Connect the MCP server to your AI client.
2. Talk to the AI naturally.
3. Let it read, plan, create, move, or update your OmniFocus tasks for you.

You do not need to memorize all tool names first.

## 🙋 What This Is Good For

- **Daily planning**: ask your AI what is due today, what is flagged, and what you can finish in 30 minutes.
- **Project setup**: give the AI a rough goal, then let it create a project and break it into subtasks.
- **Inbox cleanup**: ask it to review Inbox tasks and sort them into next actions, projects, or someday/later buckets.
- **Perspective reviews**: ask it to open one of your custom perspectives and summarize what matters.
- **Batch capture**: paste meeting notes or a brainstorm list and let the AI create multiple tasks at once.
- **Attachment-aware review**: let the AI inspect task attachments only when needed.

## 💬 Example AI Conversations

These work well in Claude Code or any MCP client that can call the same tools.

### 1. Daily Planning

Try saying:

```text
Check my Forecast and flagged tasks, then tell me the 3 most important things to do today.
Prefer tasks that take under 60 minutes first.
```

### 2. Inbox Cleanup

Try saying:

```text
Review my Inbox and group the tasks into:
1. do today
2. schedule later
3. turn into projects
Then help me clean up the obvious ones.
```

### 3. Turn an Idea Into a Project

Try saying:

```text
Create a project called "Launch spring newsletter".
Add the main subtasks, estimated minutes, and mark the most important step as flagged.
```

### 4. Use a Custom Perspective

Try saying:

```text
Open my custom perspective "今日工作安排" and summarize:
- what is due soon
- what looks blocked
- what I can finish quickly
```

### 5. Batch Add From Notes

Try saying:

```text
Turn these meeting notes into OmniFocus tasks under the project "Website Refresh".
Use subtasks where it makes sense and keep the task names short.
```

### 6. Review Attachments Only When Needed

Try saying:

```text
Find the task called "Review design draft".
Show me what attachments it has first.
Only open the image attachment if there is one.
```

## 🧭 Practical Usage Tips

- Ask the AI to **look first, then change things** if you want safer workflows.
- Use **task IDs** when you have duplicate task names.
- For **subtasks**, let the parent task determine the project. Do not also pass `projectName`.
- For `mcporter`, complex arrays are much more reliable with `--args '{...}'`.

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1. 🏗️ Subtask Management

Create complex task hierarchies with ease:

```json
// Create subtask by parent task name
{
  "name": "Analyze competitor keywords",
  "parentTaskName": "SEO Strategy",
  "note": "Focus on top 10 competitors",
  "dueDate": "2025-01-15",
  "estimatedMinutes": 120,
  "tags": ["SEO", "Research"]
}

// Create subtask by parent task ID
{
  "name": "Write content outline",
  "parentTaskId": "loK2xEAY4H1",
  "flagged": true,
  "estimatedMinutes": 60
}
```

### 2. 🔍 Perspective Views

Access all major OmniFocus perspectives programmatically:

```bash
# Inbox perspective
get_inbox_tasks {"hideCompleted": true}

# Flagged tasks
get_flagged_tasks {"projectFilter": "SEO Project"}

# Forecast (next 7 days)
get_forecast_tasks {"days": 7, "hideCompleted": true}

# Tasks by tag
get_tasks_by_tag {"tagName": "AI", "exactMatch": false}
```

### 3. 🚀 Ultimate Task Filter

Create any perspective imaginable with advanced filtering:

```bash
# Time management view (30min tasks due this week)
filter_tasks {
  "taskStatus": ["Available", "Next"],
  "estimateMax": 30,
  "dueThisWeek": true
}

# Deep work view (60+ minute tasks with notes)
filter_tasks {
  "estimateMin": 60,
  "hasNote": true,
  "taskStatus": ["Available"]
}

# Planned work view (tasks planned for today)
filter_tasks {
  "plannedToday": true,
  "sortBy": "plannedDate"
}

# Project overdue tasks
filter_tasks {
  "projectFilter": "Website Redesign",
  "taskStatus": ["Overdue", "DueSoon"]
}
```

### 4. 🌟 **NEW: Native Custom Perspective Access**

Access your OmniFocus custom perspectives with hierarchical task display:

```bash
# 🌟 NEW: List all your custom perspectives
list_custom_perspectives {"format": "detailed"}

# 🌳 NEW: Project tree view (default)
get_custom_perspective_tasks {
  "perspectiveName": "今日工作安排",  # Your custom perspective name
  "displayMode": "project_tree",    # project_tree | task_tree | flat
  "hideCompleted": true
}

# Global task tree (legacy showHierarchy=true equivalent)
get_custom_perspective_tasks {
  "perspectiveName": "Today Review",
  "displayMode": "task_tree"
}

# Flat list (legacy groupByProject=false equivalent)
get_custom_perspective_tasks {
  "perspectiveName": "Weekly Planning",
  "displayMode": "flat"
}
```

**Why This Is Powerful:**
- ✅ **Native Integration** - Uses OmniFocus `Perspective.Custom` API directly
- ✅ **Tree Structure** - Visual parent-child task relationships with ├─, └─ symbols
- ✅ **Project-First Grouping** - Project header first, then nested subtasks
- ✅ **Readable Metadata** - Full notes and `#tags` in tree output
- ✅ **AI-Friendly** - Enhanced descriptions prevent tool selection confusion
- ✅ **Professional Output** - Clean, readable task hierarchies

### 5. 🎯 Batch Operations

Efficiently manage multiple tasks:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Website Technical SEO",
      "projectName": "SEO Project",
      "note": "Optimize technical aspects"
    },
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Page Speed Optimization",
      "parentTaskName": "Website Technical SEO",
      "estimatedMinutes": 180,
      "flagged": true
    },
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Mobile Responsiveness",
      "parentTaskName": "Website Technical SEO",
      "estimatedMinutes": 90
    }
  ]
}
```

CLI tip for `mcporter`:

```bash
# Prefer explicit JSON args for complex arrays / nested objects
mcporter call omnifocus.batch_add_items --args '{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Website Technical SEO",
      "projectName": "SEO Project"
    }
  ]
}'
```

If you pass a subtask with `parentTaskId` or `parentTaskName`, do not also pass `projectName`. Subtasks inherit the project from their parent task.

Working `mcporter` examples:

```bash
# 1) Batch-create top-level tasks in a project
mcporter call omnifocus.batch_add_items --args '{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Parent: Category A",
      "projectName": "OmniFocus MCP Batch Test"
    },
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Parent: Category B",
      "projectName": "OmniFocus MCP Batch Test"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```bash
# 2) Create parent + child in one batch
mcporter call omnifocus.batch_add_items --args '{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Parent: Category A",
      "projectName": "OmniFocus MCP Batch Test"
    },
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Child: A1",
      "parentTaskName": "Parent: Category A"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```bash
# 3) Safer two-step flow when adding many subtasks to existing parents
mcporter call omnifocus.batch_add_items --args '{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Child: A1",
      "parentTaskName": "Parent: Category A"
    },
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Child: A2",
      "parentTaskName": "Parent: Category A"
    },
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Child: B1",
      "parentTaskName": "Parent: Category B"
    }
  ]
}'
```

This will fail, by design:

```bash
mcporter call omnifocus.batch_add_items --args '{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "task",
      "name": "Child: A1",
      "projectName": "OmniFocus MCP Batch Test",
      "parentTaskName": "Parent: Category A"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Because a subtask must inherit its project from the parent task.

### 6. 🖼️ Attachment Inspection

Discover images and linked files on a task first, then read only the attachment you need:

```bash
# List task details plus attachment metadata
get_task_by_id {
  "taskId": "abc123"
}

# Open an attachment returned by get_task_by_id
read_task_attachment {
  "taskId": "abc123",
  "attachmentId": "embedded-1"
}
```

`get_task_by_id` now reports attachment IDs, names, MIME guesses, source (`embedded` vs `linked`), and sizes when available. `read_task_attachment` returns images as MCP image content when possible, so AI clients can inspect the image directly instead of parsing base64 from plain text.

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

### Basic Task Creation
```bash
# Simple task
add_omnifocus_task {
  "name": "Review quarterly goals",
  "projectName": "Planning",
  "dueDate": "2025-01-31",
  "plannedDate": "2025-01-28"
}
```

### Advanced Task Management
```bash
# Create parent task
add_omnifocus_task {
  "name": "Launch Product Campaign",
  "projectName": "Marketing",
  "dueDate": "2025-02-15",
  "tags": ["Campaign", "Priority"]
}

# Add subtasks
add_omnifocus_task {
  "name": "Design landing page",
  "parentTaskName": "Launch Product Campaign",
  "estimatedMinutes": 240,
  "flagged": true
}
```

### Task Move Operations
```bash
# Move task to a project
move_task {
  "id": "task-id-123",
  "targetProjectName": "Planning"
}

# Move task under another task
move_task {
  "id": "task-id-123",
  "targetParentTaskId": "parent-task-id-456"
}

# Move task back to inbox
move_task {
  "id": "task-id-123",
  "targetInbox": true
}
```

Task move safety rules:
- Name lookups fail fast on duplicates and ask you to use IDs.
- Destination must be exactly one type: project OR parent task OR inbox.
- Moving a task into itself/its descendants is blocked to prevent cycles.

You can also move with `edit_item` and combine move + field updates:
```bash
edit_item {
  "itemType": "task",
  "id": "task-id-123",
  "newProjectName": "Planning",
  "newName": "Review tmux workflow",
  "newFlagged": true
}
```

### Smart Task Discovery
```bash
# Find high-priority work
filter_tasks {
  "flagged": true,
  "taskStatus": ["Available"],
  "estimateMax": 120,
  "hasEstimate": true
}

# Today's completed work
filter_tasks {
  "completedToday": true,
  "taskStatus": ["Completed"],
  "sortBy": "project"
}
```

### 🌟 Custom Perspective Usage
```bash
# List your custom perspectives
list_custom_perspectives {"format": "detailed"}

# Access a custom perspective with project tree
get_custom_perspective_tasks {
  "perspectiveName": "Today Review",
  "displayMode": "project_tree",
  "hideCompleted": true
}

# Quick flat view of weekly planning
get_custom_perspective_tasks {
  "perspectiveName": "Weekly Planning",
  "displayMode": "flat"
}
```
